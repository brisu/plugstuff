##What does this do?
This is a script to change the background of plug.dj and do a few other things as well which are listed and described below.

## Installation
Following these steps will load a javascript into your browser that'll allow you to change your background and move things around the screen.

###Youtube videos
(Coming soon, eventually, maybe)

###Pictures (The old fashion way)
Firstly you'll need a copy of this, you may then proceed with the rest of the steps

``` javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/umcookies/plugstuff/master/BGChanger/BGChanger.js');}()); ```

The basic idea is that you paste the line above into the URL or Location section of a bookmark and then open the bookmark when you're in a plug.dj room, the script will stay active until you refresh your page.

####For Firefox
1- Create a new bookmark and then right click on it and select Properties, which will open this popup

-In the name box you may call the bookmark anything you like, I personally call it BGChanger

-In the location box you MUST enter the script exactly as shown above

2- If you have done everything correctly your bookmark will look like this (Remember you can call the bookmark whatever you'd like)

##Ok, so how do I use it?
That's a fantastic question, I'm glad you asked

The script is built around the idea of being able to modify as much as possible on the fly via commands that you enter into chat, so I had better create a list of the commands that you can use, how you use them and what they actually do.
#####Commands


|Command |  Description |
|:------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|/background| Opens a popup that allows you to enter a URL to a picture hosted somewhere on the internet |
