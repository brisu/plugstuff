###Pictures (The old fashion way)
Firstly you'll need a copy of this, you may then proceed with the rest of the steps

``` javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/umcookies/plugstuff/master/BGChanger/BGChanger.js');}()); ```

The basic idea is that you paste the line above into the URL or Location section of a bookmark and then open the bookmark when you're in a plug.dj room, the script will stay active until you refresh your page.

####For Firefox
1- Create a new bookmark and then right click on it and select Properties, which will open this popup

-In the name box you may call the bookmark anything you like, I personally call it BGChanger

-In the location box you MUST enter the script exactly as shown above

2- If you have done everything correctly your bookmark will look like this (Remember you can call the bookmark whatever you'd like)
